<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is my first complete website completely done in HTML and CSS. I've always wanted to understand how and what makes a program and website function. This is my real first-hand look at how things on the web are created. As a beginner, this has taken me weeks to complete. I've learned how to use tags, elements, and CSS to mold this page into what it is. Enjoy. Feedback is welcomed.</p>
